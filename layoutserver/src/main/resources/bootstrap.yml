# When build the package with Test, maven build process
# will need to connect to the config server. As we
# encrypt the password in the config server, we will need to
# provide the decrypt key in one of the following ways
# 1. In bootstrap.yml, encrypt.key attribute
# 2. When build, add -Dencrypt.key=XXXXXX to the mvn command
# 3. Setup environment variables ENCRYPT_KEY:XXXXXX. This seems not working for Windows
#    -- When using docker, the environment variable works well. We will pass in through
#       docker-compose file.

#  key: "XXXXX"
